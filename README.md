# Netflix Content Analysis using Power BI

This project analyzes Netflix’s content catalog to understand how the platform distributes its movies and TV shows across genres, countries, and time.

## Problem Statement
Netflix hosts a large and diverse content library spread across countries, genres, and formats.
Without a consolidated view, it is difficult to quickly understand:
- The balance between Movies and TV Shows
- Dominant content ratings and categories

This dashboard solves this by presenting a single-page analytical overview of Netflix’s content catalog.
